```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F}
## load rtweet and dplyr packages
library(rtweet)
library(dplyr)

# set default code output to False
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
```


```{r fetch tweets, message=F}
## first, follow steps in <https://rtweet.info/> to setup API and relevant tokens

## search for 18000 tweets using the rstats hashtag

)
```

### Basic summary

There were a total of **`r nrow(rt)`** tweets with the #CEFP2019 hashtag. These tweets were authored by **`r length(unique(rt$screen_name))`** different particpants.


```{r tweet_timeline}
# tweet timeline
ts_plot(rt, "2 hours") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::theme(plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(face = "bold")) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = NULL, y = NULL,
    title = "Frequency of #CEFP tweets",
    subtitle = "Twitter status (tweet) counts aggregated using two-hour intervals",
    caption = "\nSource: Data collected from Twitter's REST API via rtweet"
  )

```


```{r top5favs}
# top 5 favorited 
top5favs <- rt %>%
  top_n(5, favorite_count) %>%
  arrange(desc(favorite_count)) %>%
  select(screen_name, text)
top5favs <- as.data.frame(top5favs)
top5favs
```

This code was adapted from FranÃ§ois Michonneau's [code](https://github.com/fmichonneau/2018-carpentrycon-tweets/blob/master/index.Rmd) that he used to create this [blog post about twitter statistics from Carpentry Con 2018](https://carpentries.org/2018/06/carpentrycon-tweets). The [`rtweet` package](https://rtweet.info/) had excellent documentation.
